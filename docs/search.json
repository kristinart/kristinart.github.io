    "text": "Growing Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI grew up in San Leandro, California and Reno, Nevada. My family moved to Reno right before my sophomore year of high school, which felt like the end of the world as a fifteen year old girl. Little did I know then that living in Reno (45 minutes away from Tahoe) would help me discover a love for the outdoors and send me down the best career path I could imagine.\nIn 2011, I transferred to a magnet high school, where I took community college courses for dual credit. It was there that I found a mentor in my microbiology course professor; I would not be where I am today without her encouragement, support, and passion! Thanks to her, I began interning at the Desert Research Institute in 2012, where I spent my time meticulously measuring Antarctic krill under a microscope (too bad I did not know about podcasts back then - I could have listened to so many true crime episodes).\nAfter receiving my Associate of Science in 2013, I decided I was ahead of the game and could afford to take a gap year. That year turned into 3.5 years away from academia… I spent the first 2.5 years volunteering with a service program focused on community development; through the program, I traveled across the contiguous US, Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Korea and met tons of amazing humans. After coming home, I spent another year working in the service industry and applying to transfer into a university."

In the research labs, I helped multiple PhD students study the growth and toxicity of phytoplankton species under various climate conditions. Although I have since steered my career away from this topic, I still love geeking out about phytoplankton and harmful algal blooms."
