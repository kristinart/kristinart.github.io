    "text": "Growing Up\nI grew up in San Leandro, California and Reno, Nevada. My family moved to Reno right before my sophomore year of high school, which felt like the end of the world as a fifteen year old girl. Little did I know then that living in Reno (45 minutes away from Tahoe) would help me discover my love for the outdoors and set me off on the best career path I could imagine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, I transferred to a magnet high school, where I took community college courses for dual credit. It was there that I found a mentor in the professor for my first microbiology course; I would not be where I am today without her encouragement, support, and passion! Thanks to her, I began interning at the Desert Research Institute in 2012, where I spent my time meticulously measuring Antarctic krill under a microscope (too bad I did not know about podcasts back then - I could have listened to so many true crime episodes).\nAfter receiving my Associate of Science in 2013, I decided I was ahead of the game and could afford to take a gap year. That year turned into 3.5 years away from academia… I spent the first 2.5 years volunteering with a service program focused on community development; through the program, I travelled across the contiguous US, Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Korea and met so many amazing humans during these adventures. After coming home, I spent another year working in the service industry and applying to transfer into a university.\nI decided to attend the University of Southern California (USC) beginning in January 2017; as a first-generation college student from a low-income family, the decision was easy since USC offered me a full ride. I graduated with a BS in Biological Sciences and an emphasis in Marine and Environmental Biology in December 2019. During my time at USC, I was lucky enough to assist two research labs in studying the growth and toxicity production of multiple phytoplankton species under various climate conditions."

Not only was I ecstatic to be back in the East Bay Area, but the position was a wholesome blend of fieldwork, labwork, and data analysis. My team, the Nutrient Management Strategy, utilized coupled biogeochemical-hydrodynamic modeling and monitoring to understand the current and future health of the San Francisco Bay Area. I was part of the monitoring team and became the field lead of a network of water quality monitoring instruments in the San Francisco Bay called the Moored Sensor Program. This position involved everything from coordinating with US Geological Survey (USGS) collaborators for regular fieldwork to technical troubleshooting of our instruments to QA/QC of the measured data in Python. Speaking of Python, this was my first introduction to the language and boy did I struggle to learn it. It was only with the continued patience and help of my genius supervisor (and many hours on Stack Overflow) that I became proficient in the language. I laugh now because I have since fallen in love with data science and hope to spend the majority of time during my next career position coding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretending to captain the research vessel (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly morning sunrise in Alviso Slough (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing a research buoy for deployment (2022)"
