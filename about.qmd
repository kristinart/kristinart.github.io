#### Here's a little information about me, if you're interested. (Actually it's a lot, let's be real). 

## Growing Up

I grew up in San Leandro, California and Reno, Nevada. My family moved to Reno right before my sophomore year of high school, which felt like the end of the world as a fifteen year old girl. Little did I know then that living in Reno (45 minutes away from Tahoe) would help me discover my love for the outdoors and set me off on the best career path I could imagine.

In 2011, I transferred to a magnet high school, where I took community college courses for dual credit. It was there that I found a mentor in my microbiology course professor; I would not be where I am today without her encouragement, support, and passion! Thanks to her, I began interning at the Desert Research Institute in 2012, where I spent my time meticulously measuring Antarctic krill under a microscope (too bad I did not know about podcasts back then - I could have listened to so many true crime episodes). 

After receiving my Associate of Science in 2013, I decided I was ahead of the game and could afford to take a gap year. That year turned into 3.5 years away from academia... I spent the first 2.5 years volunteering with a service program focused on community development; through the program, I travelled across the contiguous US, Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Korea and met so many amazing humans during these adventures. After coming home, I spent another year working in the service industry and applying to transfer into a university. 

I decided to attend the University of Southern California (USC) beginning in January 2017; as a first-generation college student from a low-income family, the decision was easy since USC offered me a full ride. I graduated with a BS in Biological Sciences and an emphasis in Marine and Environmental Biology in December 2019. During my time at USC, I was lucky enough to assist two research labs in studying the growth and toxicity production of multiple phytoplankton species under various climate conditions.

## Back to the East Bay and into Water Quality Work!

A couple weeks after graduating, I began working as an Environmental Analyst at the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI). Not only was I ecstatic to be back in the East Bay Area, but the position was a wholesome blend of fieldwork, labwork, and data analysis. My team, the Nutrient Management Strategy, utilized coupled biogeochemical-hydrodynamic modeling and monitoring to understand the current and future health of the San Francisco Bay Area. I was part of the monitoring team and became the field lead of a network of water quality monitoring instruments in the San Francisco Bay called the Moored Sensor Program. This position involved everything from coordinating with US Geological Survey (USGS) collaborators for regular fieldwork to technical troubleshooting of our instruments to QA/QC of the measured data in Python. Speaking of Python, this was my first introduction to the language and boy did I struggle to learn it. It was only with the continued patience and help of my genius supervisor (and many hours on Stack Overflow) that I became proficient in the language. I laugh now because I have since fallen in love with data science and hope to spend the majority of time during my next career position coding.

## Graduate School and my Shift to Data Science in the Energy Sector

In September of 2022, I began pursuing a Master's in Environmental Science & Management at the Bren School at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I've focused my coursework on energy, climate, corporate sustainability, and data science. I particularly enjoy analyzing and communicating data from the energy sector. I spent the summer of 2023 interning at the Environmental Protection Agency federal headquarters in Washington, D.C., where I did data analyses and visualizations of power sector emissions for the Clean Air Markets Division. Now, most of my focus is concentrated on finishing our [group master's project](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/identifying-geographic-feasibility-californias-hydrogen-hub), which aims to analyze the parity between potential supply and demand of hydrogen as an alternative fuel source in California. 

## Hobbies

In my free time, I love to mountain bike, camp, cook, swim, read, and puzzle. In 2020, I went on my first bikepacking trip and fell in love. Since then, I've gone on 7 or so multi-day trips with amazing friends in places like Tahoe National Forest, the Lost Coast, Catalina Island, and more. Please enjoy the photos below as we collectively pretend we are in the mountains instead of behind a desk. I also love spending time with my cuddly cat, Lilo.
